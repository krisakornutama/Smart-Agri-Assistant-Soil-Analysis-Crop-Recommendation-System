# Smart-Agri-Assistant-Soil-Analysis-Crop-Recommendation-System
Farmers in Phang Khon lack soil tools, causing high costs. This study built a portable AI prototype using a 7-in-1 sensor and ESP32 with an MLP model. To fix low accuracy, a Hybrid Logic system was added via a Web App. This provides reliable, real-time crop advice, helping farmers make better decisions directly in the field.
